### TODO

### i3blocks module for pacman upgrades.
### Displays number of upgradeable packages.
### For this to work, have a `pacman -Sy` command run in the background as a
### cronjob every so often as root. This script will then read those packages.
### When clicked, it will run an upgrade via pacman.

### TODO - this is bad, apparently it starts looping and the pc freezes
